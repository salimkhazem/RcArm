Rc ARM is a robotic arm controlled by radiofrequency 

The robot arm uses three conventional PWM servos, and each angle is controlled by a variable resistor by RC. The rotary potentiometer used B curve 10k ohm.
For this project i used 2 Arduino, one for the Transmitter and another one for the receiver, 
i also used 3 potentiometer for control the position of each Servomotor. 

For radiocommunication, i used the NRF24L01 Module in each microcontroller
